# Issue
The camera has 6db lower gain on all positive gain values.
Tested with URSA Broadcast that only displays gain in db and not iso.

# SDI shield
The gain issue does not seem to exist when using the SDI shield.
That is probably because the problematic gain command is not processed by the shield.

# Gain is updated in 2 ways
* The `0x01 0x0d` does not update the camera on all values, but when updated, the value in the camera matches what is in the switcher.
* The `0x01 0x01` is only sent when `0x01 0x0d` sends 6 12 and 18 db gain and it updates it to 0 6 and 12, so 6db too low.

# Gain table

| db   | db hex | iso hex |	iso  |
|------|--------|---------|------|
| 0db  | 0x00   | 0x02    | 200  |
| 6db  | 0x06   | 0x04    | 400  |
| 12db | 0x0c   | 0x08    | 800  |
| 18db | 0x12   | 0x10    | 1600 |
| none | 0x18   | 0x20    | none |

# Ways to fix issue?
* Currently, `0x01 0x01` is filtered out completely and that seems to work.

* Test putting both gain data blocks in the same packet and see if the second one is filtered out by the camera then?
	* Unable to test since message grouping did not seem to work at all. Only the first command was registered no matter what came after.
